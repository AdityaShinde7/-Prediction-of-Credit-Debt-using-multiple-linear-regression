#  Prediction of Credit Debt using multiple linear regression
 A machine learning algorithm that predicts credit card users' debt has been developed. Explanatory data analysis was carried out in order to determine the variables that would be important for forecasting credit debt. The Multiple Linear regression model was created using R. I have achieved 75% accuracy for this prediction.
